It is well known that aneuploidy often results in a phenotypic syndrome.  However, the exact process through which altered copy number of sequences leads to phenotypic changes has not been well characterized in plant or animal systems.  We used a segmental aneuploidy that is trisomic for most of the short arm of maize chromosome 5 to profile how aneuploidy affects the transcriptome.  These studies found evidence that aneuploidy may interfere with proper developmental timing of gene expression.  Several genes were found that exhibit ectopic expression in tissues where they are normally silent.
