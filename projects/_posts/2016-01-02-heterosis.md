Heterosis, or hybrid vigor, refers to the phenomena in which hybrid off-spring exhibits phenotypic characteristics that are superior to either parent.  This genetic phenomenon has a substantial impact upon human agriculture practices and is widely used in many crop species despite a complete lack of an understanding of its molecular basis.  During the course of a series of studies on allelic variation among maize lines and the prevalence of cis- and trans-regulatory variation, we gathered gene expression profiles for a series of inbred and hybrid maize lines.  While there is extensive variation in gene expression levels among maize genotypes, most hybrids express genes at the mid-parent level or within the range of the parents.  It is quite rare to observe hybrid gene expression levels that are outside of the parental range of expression for that gene.  Recent studies have focused on further defining the phenomena of heterosis and developing detailed information for a variety of phenotypes in many different hybrids.
