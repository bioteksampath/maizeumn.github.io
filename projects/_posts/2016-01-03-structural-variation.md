While many biologists tend to think of individuals within a species as having very similar genomes there is growing evidence for major differences in the structure of genomes in different individuals of the same species.  This structural genomic variation includes insertion/deletions, inversions and translocations.  The insertion/deletions include examples of copy number variation (CNV) where different individuals possess different copy numbers for the same sequence and presence-absence variation (PAV) where some individuals contain a sequence while others lack this sequence.  In collaboration with Patrick Schnable Iowa State University) and Jeffrey Jeddeloh (Roche NimbleGen) we have used comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to study structural variation among maize inbreds.  There are numerous examples of CNV and PAV among different maize genotypes.  Current efforts are focused on understanding the contributions of these CNV and PAV to phenotypic diversity in maize.
