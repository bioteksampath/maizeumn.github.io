Most plant and animal species require contributions of genetic material from both a maternal and paternal parent.  While the genetic material contributed by the two parents can be very similar there are some regions that are differently marked, or imprinted, based upon which parent it was inherited from.  This imprinting results in differential expression of two alleles depending upon their parent-of-origin.  The majority of imprinting documented in plant species occurs in endosperm tissue.  The maize seed includes a large, persistent endosperm and provides a useful model system for studying imprinting.  My group documented imprinting at the Mez1 locus of maize.  We characterized several chromatin modifications associated with imprinting and have studied the effects of transposable elements on imprinting.  Current efforts have focused on genome-wide analysis of parent-of-origin effects on the maize transcriptome.
