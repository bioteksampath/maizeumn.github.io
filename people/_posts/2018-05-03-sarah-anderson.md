Plant genomes vary widely in size and DNA content, both among species and within members of the same species. Much of this variation can be attributed to transposable elements (TEs), which can transpose through either a copy-and-paste mechanism (retrotransposons) or a cut-and-paste mechanism (DNA transposons). In maize, the majority of genetic sequence is comprised of structurally intact retrotransposons. TEs are in constant conflict with the genome, selfishly increasing in copy number while the genome employs mechanisms to reduce the detrimental effects of TE movement and accumulation. Most TE insertions are deleterious or at best neutral, but TEs are distinct from other common mutation types (SNPs and indels) in that they can introduce regulatory elements and alter the chromatin state of a region upon transposition. This means that TEs have a unique potential to create beneficial alleles by altering expression of nearby genes. My research broadly aims to understand how variable transposable elements influence genomes, transcriptomes, and epigenomes.
