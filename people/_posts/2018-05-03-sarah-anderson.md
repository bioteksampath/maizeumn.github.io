Plant genomes vary widely in size and DNA content, both among species and within members of the same species. Much of this variation can be attributed to transposable elements (TEs), which can transpose through either a copy-and-paste mechanism (retrotransposons) or a cut-and-paste mechanism (DNA transposons). In maize, the majority of genetic sequence is comprised of structurally intact retrotransposons. TEs are in constant conflict with the genome, selfishly increasing in copy number while the genome employs mechanisms to reduce the detrimental effects of TE movement and accumulation. In my research, I aim to understand transposable element dynamics in maize by identifying variable TE insertions among genotypes and by assessing the impacts of TEs on the transcriptome and epigenome.
