Plant genomes vary widely in size and DNA content, both among species and within members of the same species. Much of this variation can be attributed to transposable elements (TEs), which can transpose through either a copy-and-paste mechanism (retrotransposons) or a cut-and-paste mechanism (DNA transposons). In maize, the majority of genetic sequence is comprised of structurally intact retrotransposons. TEs are in constant conflict with the genome, selfishly increasing in copy number while the genome employs mechanisms to reduce the detrimental effects of TE movement and accumulation. My research in the Springer lab broadly aims to understand how different types of transposable elements influence maize genomes, transcriptomes, and epigenomes.
